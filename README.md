## The No Steam XCOM 2 Mod Launcher

This a very basic mod launcher I made so people could easily install and launch mods for the Gog and Epic Games version of XCOM 2.

This only supports Windows and you need [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework)

If you find anything wrong leave an issue please. Pull requests are also welcome and feel free to laugh at my 2 hour code :)

## Finding Mods

1. Go to [XCOM 2 Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/268500/workshop/)
2. Find the mods you want and copy the URL and download them using a site like [Steam Workshop Downloader](https://steamworkshopdownloader.io/)

3. Unpack the .zip files in your XCOM 2 Mods folder, if the folder does not exist create it
